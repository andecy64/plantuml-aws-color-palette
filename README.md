# PlantUML AWS Colors

The purpose of this project is to provide
a set of PlantUML variables containing
colors usually seen in AWS documentation
and websites.  

In addition, a procedure that creates
samples to display those colors is available
for convenience.  

The HEX codes for the colors were taken from
[this][aws-color-palette-article] article written
by Adrian Simionov.
